Notification System

    Native Push Notifications: Real-time notifications for updates, reminders, or mental health check-ins.
    Customizable Preferences: Allow users to choose what notifications they want to receive.
    Background Notification Service: Ensure notifications arrive even when the app is closed.
    Silent/Active Notifications: Ability to send notifications without disturbing the user or in the foreground.
    Local Notification Scheduling: Notifications can be scheduled based on specific times or events.

Points System (Gamification for Mental Health Tracking)

    Local Points Tracking:
        Every time users answer mental health check-ins, they can earn points based on their consistency and accuracy.

    Gamification Elements:
        Users will be encouraged to track their mental health regularly by earning badges or rewards for milestones such as "1 Week of Consistent Responses," "Completed 30 Days," etc.

    Progress Indicators:
        A visual progress bar or circle to represent their commitment to mental health tracking. For example, “You’ve tracked your mood for 7 days in a row! Keep it up.”

    Achievement Notifications:
        Push notifications or in-app alerts to congratulate users when they reach milestones or complete a goal (e.g., completing 7 consecutive days of journaling).

Usage Analytics (Admin Side)

    Native Data Collection and Export: Admins will have access to real-time data analytics on user participation, progress, and feedback. This can be exported into CSV or Excel format for further analysis.
    Engagement Monitoring Analytics: Admins can track how engaged users are with daily questions, journal entries, and notifications.
    Time Tracking and Restrictions: Admins can monitor whether users are completing their mental health tasks within specific time windows or in different time zones.

Journal Requirements

    Native Text Editor: Users should have a built-in text editor for journaling.
    Offline Draft Saving: Ensure that journal entries are saved offline if the user is not connected to the internet.
    Content Validation: Automatic checks for grammatical errors or mental health-specific terminology.
    Auto-Save System: Regular auto-saves of user input to prevent data loss.
    Rich Text Formatting: The editor should allow users to format their entries with bold, italics, and other simple formatting options.

Platform-Specific Features

    Web: A clean, responsive design that can work across all browsers. More universal, but may lack the personalized experience of mobile apps.
    Mobile: More intuitive UI/UX, specific to Android and iOS platform guidelines. Push notifications, background services, and native device features like camera, GPS, or sensor usage can be implemented.

Conclusion: Choosing the Right Platform

Web Solution: If your users need universal access from any device, especially in the workplace or for general use without the need for installing an app, a web-based solution may be the best choice. It’s cost-effective and faster to develop.

Mobile App Solution: For users who need a more personalized experience with features like offline access, push notifications, and use of native device features, a mobile app solution will offer superior engagement, especially for long-term mental health tracking.

Both platforms can support your goals, and the choice will depend on your target audience, the specific features required, and your budget.
Below is a basic React Native code structure to start building your Mental Health Data Collection Platform with the features you've outlined above. I'll give you an outline with a few key features such as user authentication, data collection, notifications, and journal features. For simplicity, we will use React Navigation for navigation, Firebase for authentication and push notifications, and React Native's AsyncStorage for offline data.
Step 1: Install Dependencies

You will need to install some dependencies first:

npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-safe-area-context react-native-screens @react-native-firebase/auth @react-native-firebase/messaging @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

Also, make sure you have Firebase set up in your project as it will handle authentication and push notifications.
Step 2: Project Structure

Here’s the suggested structure for your project:

/src
  /components
    - Button.js
    - Header.js
    - Notification.js
  /screens
    - HomeScreen.js
    - LoginScreen.js
    - JournalScreen.js
    - QuestionScreen.js
  /navigation
    - AppNavigator.js
  /services
    - authService.js
    - pushNotificationService.js
  /utils
    - storage.js
/App.js

Step 3: Firebase Setup for Push Notifications

Before we dive into the code, make sure you have Firebase set up and integrated with your React Native project. If you haven't done that yet, follow this guide: Firebase React Native Setup.
Step 4: Code Implementation
1. App.js - Entry Point and Navigation Setup

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
import { createStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/stack';
import HomeScreen from './src/screens/HomeScreen';
import LoginScreen from './src/screens/LoginScreen';
import JournalScreen from './src/screens/JournalScreen';
import QuestionScreen from './src/screens/QuestionScreen';
import { checkUserAuthentication } from './src/services/authService';
import { NotificationListener } from './src/services/pushNotificationService';

const Stack = createStackNavigator();

const App = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check user authentication state
    checkUserAuthentication(setUser);
    
    // Start listening for push notifications
    NotificationListener();

  }, []);

  return (
    <NavigationContainer>
      <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName={user ? "Home" : "Login"}>
        <Stack.Screen name="Login" component={LoginScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Journal" component={JournalScreen} />
        <Stack.Screen name="Question" component={QuestionScreen} />
      </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
  );
};

export default App;

2. authService.js - Authentication Service

import auth from '@react-native-firebase/auth';

export const checkUserAuthentication = (setUser) => {
  auth().onAuthStateChanged((user) => {
    if (user) {
      setUser(user);
    } else {
      setUser(null);
    }
  });
};

export const signIn = async (email, password) => {
  try {
    await auth().signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

export const signUp = async (email, password) => {
  try {
    await auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

export const signOut = () => {
  auth().signOut();
};

3. pushNotificationService.js - Push Notifications Setup

import messaging from '@react-native-firebase/messaging';
import { Alert } from 'react-native';

export const NotificationListener = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    messaging().onNotificationOpenedApp(remoteMessage => {
      Alert.alert('Notification Opened', remoteMessage.notification.body);
    });

    messaging().onMessage(async remoteMessage => {
      Alert.alert('New Notification', remoteMessage.notification.body);
    });

    messaging()
      .getInitialNotification()
      .then(remoteMessage => {
        if (remoteMessage) {
          Alert.alert('App Opened from Notification', remoteMessage.notification.body);
        }
      });
  }, []);
};

export const requestUserPermission = async () => {
  const authStatus = await messaging().requestPermission();
  const enabled =
    authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.AUTHORIZED ||
    authStatus === messaging.AuthorizationStatus.PROVISIONAL;
  
  if (enabled) {
    const token = await messaging().getToken();
    console.log('FCM Token:', token); // Save this token in your database for notifications
  }
};

4. QuestionScreen.js - Daily Questions Screen

import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button, TextInput } from 'react-native';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const QuestionScreen = () => {
  const [response, setResponse] = useState('');

  const handleSaveResponse = async () => {
    try {
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('response', response);
      alert('Response saved!');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>How are you feeling today?</Text>
      <TextInput
        placeholder="Your response"
        value={response}
        onChangeText={setResponse}
      />
      <Button title="Save Response" onPress={handleSaveResponse} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default QuestionScreen;

5. JournalScreen.js - Journal Entry Screen

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TextInput, Button } from 'react-native';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

const JournalScreen = () => {
  const [journalText, setJournalText] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    const loadDraft = async () => {
      const savedText = await AsyncStorage.getItem('journal');
      if (savedText) {
        setJournalText(savedText);
      }
    };

    loadDraft();
  }, []);

  const handleSaveJournal = async () => {
    try {
      await AsyncStorage.setItem('journal', journalText);
      alert('Journal saved!');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Write your journal entry:</Text>
      <TextInput
        multiline
        placeholder="Journal..."
        value={journalText}
        onChangeText={setJournalText}
      />
      <Button title="Save Journal" onPress={handleSaveJournal} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default JournalScreen;

6. HomeScreen.js - Home Screen with Sign-Out

import React from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
import { signOut } from '../services/authService';

const HomeScreen = ({ navigation }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Welcome to the Mental Health Tracker</Text>
      <Button title="Go to Journal" onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Journal')} />
      <Button title="Go to Questions" onPress={() => navigation.navigate('Question')} />
      <Button title="Sign Out" onPress={signOut} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;

Step 5: Implement the Push Notification Listener (When App is in Foreground)

Make sure the app listens for push notifications when it's in the foreground and background using Firebase. You can configure this in the pushNotificationService.js.
Conclusion

This is a starter template for the mental health data collection platform. It includes basic setups for user authentication, push notifications, and journal/response management. For production, you’ll need to integrate real-time data collection, error handling, data encryption, and scalable cloud infrastructure like Firebase, AWS, or others.
